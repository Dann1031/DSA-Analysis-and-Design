# DSA-Analysis-and-Design
In this college course CS-300 : DSA: Analysis and Design we learned the concepts of data structures and algorithms. 

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course we worked with data models suchs as Binary trees, Hash Tables, Linked Lists and how they tied together in an application. 

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I used the information provided within this course to approach my problems. When using data structures, we go based on what the program is calling for. This will give us an idea of how the program shall work.  

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
overall this coursr was challeging. Working with C++ when only taking one course did not make this course easy. I overcame these roadblock by digging deeper and doing addictional research on the langauage to try and make my programs work. 

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
prior to this course, I did not have much knowledge of hash tables, vectors, list linksor binary search trees. I still do not have the best knowlegde of them but I have a more better understanding of how they work. 

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
After working on this project I have a better undrstanding of how to sort data structures.
